                        to cultivate social incorporation or utilizing advanced stages to cultivate cooperation.</br></br>
                        The fast pace of digitalization and mechanical changes is quickly reshaping youth work, so at
                        the
                        same time, digitalization is of incredible significance for the advancement of modern aptitudes
                        and competences of both youthful individuals and youth specialists. Computerized apparatuses
                        have a wide extend of ventures and offer us an inventive way of learning by sparing time. In
                        expansion, youthful individuals appear a part of intrigued in computerized areas and it makes
                        sense for NGOs and youth workers to adjust to this and take unused steps within the
                        digitalization of conventional instruction.</br></br>
                        As a conclusion the following parts are showing that why do we need to transform digitally:</br>
                        -To help people learn about how NGOs can plan and use digital strategies to improve their
                        abilities and services for youth.</br>
                        -To help people who work with youth who may feel left out or have trouble communicating, we

                        will teach them how to use digital tools and creative methods. This will be especially helpful
                        during times of crisis or when communication is difficult.</br>
                        -To provide youth workers with new skills and knowledge, so they can help vulnerable youth feel
                        included and safe in the digital world.</br>
                        -To make a space for youth from the EU and other countries to communicate with each other and
                        have inclusive conversations about different cultures.</br>
                        -To create a network for youth to work on digital transformation projects. After the projects,
                        we</br>
                        will organize local activities to use the skills and knowledge gained to improve collaboration
                        between partners.</br>
                        - To help people and organizations work together after a project and improve their abilities.
